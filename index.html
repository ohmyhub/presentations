<p>
I&rsquo;m not a programmer.
</p>

<p>
I&rsquo;m a professional CAD drafter specializing in civil engineering, most
specifically in stormwater infrastructure, river and floodplain management, and
ecological restoration.
</p>

<p>
I&rsquo;m the kind of software user who chases shiny novel things, that doesn&rsquo;t take
the time to understand what their doing before they start doing it, and will
tinker with my tools until they break.
</p>

<p>
It might be difficult for the power users of doom to put themselves in the mind
of someone who doesn&rsquo;t have a good understanding of programming in general, let
alone elisp, and what that means in terms of providing those people support.
Being able to anticipate the problems the novice user might face can help you
setup systems to help them without requiring you to answer the same questions in
chat every single day. What kind of issues might arise if core contributors
start to resent new users?
</p>

<p>
I&rsquo;ve installed and used doom emacs on more systems then I can easily remember.
</p>

<p>
Windows 10 Enterprise, WSL1 and WSL2
Windows 10 Personal, WSL1 and WSL2 (triple boot)
Windows 11 WSL2 with WSLg (triple boot)
WSL distros
Fedora, Ubuntu, OpenSUSE
Ubuntu VPS
Ubuntu desktop (triple boot)
Manjaro (triple boot)
EndeavorOS
Arch
Termux
Windows Subsystem for Android
</p>

<p>
Finally, I hope that anyone who is interested in trying doom emacs takes the
leap. I&rsquo;ve managed to bungle my way into using doom emacs by being curious,
breaking things countless times, and by lurking around the community of it&rsquo;s
regular users.

<h2 id="org41e5032">When did I Emacs?</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>
It all started on the crisp winter morning of December 17th, 1992. Father was
off in the war and mother was lost in a haze of laudanum. I was a quiet childâ€¦

<li class="fragment appear">I think it was about 2-3 years ago</li>
<li class="fragment appear">I liked linux</li>
<li class="fragment appear">Never used it as a daily driver</li>
<li class="fragment appear">First tried it over a decade ago</li>

<aside class="notes">
<p>
I&rsquo;ve known that <code>Emacs</code> existed for many years but never felt tempted to try it.
</p>

<p>
I saw a video of someone using their terminal and their terminal prompt used
powerline separators. I thought that was super cool and that rabbit hole
eventually led me to Spacemacs. It was interesting but I considered it a novelty
and gave it up after a couple months.
</p>

<p>
Then I stumbled over a series of <code>Youtube</code> videos about <code>Doom Emacs</code> about 3 years
ago. That would be <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/ZaisteProgramming/featured">Zaiste Programming</a> and his <code>Doomcast</code> series. There are 27
videos to date ranging from about 3 minutes to 10 minutes per video.
</p>

<p>
This was an excellent gateway to learning more about <code>Doom Emacs</code> and once I saw
the possibilities I was enamored.

<aside class="notes">
<p>
At this point I mainly use <code>Emacs</code> for it&rsquo;s <code>org-mode</code> and I use <code>org-mode</code> for taking
notes, journaling, and task management. I have many meetings and phone calls
that are all virtual and I&rsquo;m terrible at paying attention or retaining
information under those circumstances.
</p>

<p>
So I use <code>org-mode</code> to take frequent and copious notes. For every phone call and
meeting I will take notes and often create a loose list of tasks that I&rsquo;ll
refine after the meeting and possibly integrate into my larger task list if I&rsquo;m
feeling organized.
</p>

<p>
I also use it to keep track of my D&amp;D campaigns both as a player and a DM.
</p>

<p>
The only thing I&rsquo;ve used org-roam for is creating a daily journal entry.

I use a single org file that I use to track my professional projects. Each

usually link to an external document that I use for notes on the relevant

<p>
I do something similar for personal project management.

I use doom emacs so I can get better at using doom emacs. For the last 2 years
one of my main hobbies has been configuring emacs. I used to see emacs not as a
tool but a toy. Any practical use that I squeezed out of it was a bonus. It&rsquo;s
less of a toy and more of a tool for me now.

<p>
I use <code>Emacs</code> on several different systems so my workflow varies.
</p>

<p>
For my job I have a desktop PC with an Enterprise version of <code>Windows 10</code> that is
on the Government update ring. For a long time I used <code>Emacs</code> within <code>WSL1</code> and
display it on an X Server within <code>Windows 10</code>. Now I&rsquo;m able to use WSL2 which has
been an improvement.
</p>

<p>
Under <code>Windows 11</code> I&rsquo;m using <code>WSL2</code> with <code>WSLg</code> which allows for displaying a linux
GUI on <code>Windows</code> without an X Server. Under the hood it&rsquo;s a mix of whatever <code>WSL2</code>
is, a different linux VM using <code>Wayland</code>, and <code>RDP</code>. But I&rsquo;m still using <code>Emacs 28</code>
with native-comp and native <code>GTK</code> even though the latter might be useless.

Dual boot
</p>
<aside class="notes">
<p>
I have VPS with <code>Ubuntu</code> on it that I used to remote into extensively and accessed
Emacs via X-Forwarding. For almost a year this was my main linux and emacs
environment.
</p>

<p>
At one point I was on my personal desktop that had Windows 10 using RDP to
remote into my work desktop, then using WSL within that to ssh -X into my VPS. I
used doom emacs via that convoluted system and by comparison having native emacs
on a linux machine is wonderful.
</p>

<p>
Eventually I dual booted my PC with Ubuntu and Windows. Ubuntu never quite
became my daily driver but I used it and inevitably doom emacs frequently.

<p>
Up until about 3 weeks ago I triple booted my PC with <code>Manjaro</code> linux and <code>Windows
11</code>. <code>Manjaro</code> was my first linux daily driver. I had the sway window manager and
went Wayland native. Under <code>Manjaro</code> I&rsquo;m using a mostly Wayland environment and
have <code>Emacs 28</code> with native-comp and native <code>GTK</code>.
